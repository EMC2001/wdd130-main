    <p>Hi! My name is Emiliano Medina
      Im from a place called Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico.I'm 22 and I've always loved playing volleyball and traveling. </p>
     <p> My favorite videogame is Red Dead Redemption 2
      I'm currently going for a major at Software Engineering. I've been a member of The Church my whole life and I love it.</p>
      <p>My favorite scripture is in Alma chapter 26 verse 11 "11 But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God"
        I love that scripture and I try to always live by it.
      </p>
